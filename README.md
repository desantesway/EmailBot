# üìß Python Cold Email Automation with Open & Reply Tracking

This web app automates **cold email campaigns** with **open & reply tracking**.  
It integrates with **Google Sheets** for campaign management, supports **multiple senders**, and enforces **daily sending limits** per account.

## üìä Google Sheets Integration

A Google Sheets document is used to control email sending and track statistics.  
You can get a copy of the template [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IuEbKSy8YDeLrlz0ngSyRuTjIQoC_BEiEqjS7ZuCGCI/edit?usp=sharing).

- Add your email addresses in the cells `O9`, `P9`, `Q9`, etc.
- **From** ‚Üí the sender‚Äôs email.  
- **Email** ‚Üí the recipient‚Äôs email.  
- **Preset** ‚Üí template number (from the *Templates* sheet, starting at `0`).  
  - Example: `E0` = first email, `E1` = second email, etc.  
- **E1 Date** ‚Üí delay (in days) before sending the follow-up if there was no reply.  
- **Custom Variables** ‚Üí placeholders for personalization (use `{var}` format).  

The sheet automatically calculates averages and performance metrics for each sender.
